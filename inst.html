        Popular instruments used in the 1600s.

        The Lute.
    </h1>
    <p>
        The lute is a stringed instrument and can be seen as a predecessor to the modern day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar">guitar</a> <br>It could be plucked and strummed just like a guitar but had much more strings, potentially having up to 15 strings. <br>The lute originates from Arabic countries with instruments like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oud">Arabid Oud</a> being eerily similar to the European lute. <br>The oud was brought to Europe through Spain in the 8th and 9th centuries and gained popularity through the continent before creating its own version thus known as the lute in the 13th century. <br>The lute was generally used for music to be able to dance along to, before slowly the pieces gradually became more nuanced and complicated with more techniques and fingerwork. <br>The lute also had a variant called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archlute">Archlute</a> , being a hybrid between the lute and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorbo">Theorbo.</a>

        The Harpsichord.
    </h1>
    <p>
        The harpsichord, although also being a member of the string family, is actually an early predecessor to the modern day concert grand piano.<br>The harpsichord was believed to be first developed in the middle ages, and by the 16th century there were many regional variants of the harpsichord all around Europe; Italian harpsichords were lightweight and had low string tension, while Dutch variants were much heavier, giving off a more powerful sound.<br>The instrument works like this; the player presses a key, as the other end of the key rises, it lifts a long strip of wood, called a jack.<br>To the jack is attached a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plectrum">plectrum</a> as the plectrum rises, it plucks the key thus creating the sound. When the player lets go of the key, the lever returns to its original position, as the key goes back to its original position, the plectrum swivels away from the string so as to not restrike the key.<br>When the key is finally back in place, a damper on the jack touches the string to mute the sound.<br>Harpsichords possess a very distinct, metallic tone.

        Cello, Violin, Viol, Viola
    </h1>
    <p>
        The cello, violin, viol and viola are all instruments part of the main string family (also known as the violin family), many of which are still used in the modern day. <br>All possess a very distinct shape with a wooden body and fretless fretboard. <br>Although they can be plucked, the correct way to play them is by using a bow to create their sound. <br>Cellos are part of the string family and are the largest, next to the double bass, the cello's strings are tuned an octave lower than the viola and it has 4 strings. <br>The instrument is to be played while sitting on a stool or a chair with the cello sitting comfortably in between your lap, and bowed with your dominant hand. <br>The cello has a very low, warm tone and is played in bass clef. <br>Violas have 4 strings and are an octave higher than the cello, with a midrange or “alto” tone and are slightly larger than violins. <br>Violins are the smallest of the 3, as well as being the most popular out of all other strings in the family, as every other instrument in the violin was some sort of variation or alteration of the violin. <br>It also possesses 4 strings with higher tuning than the cello or viola. <br>The instrument is played in a very high pitched “soprano” range. Finally, the viol, the least known of the violin family as it is not very commonly seen or used today. <br>The viol ranges in size from soprano, tenor and bass, with the bass variant being as large as a cello. The viol, like the cello is also to be played in between the legs, but unlike all other instruments in the violin family, the viol has 6 strings as well as frets.
