        Claudio monteverdi (1567-1643)
    </h1>
    <p>
        Taught by marc’antonio ingegneri<br>
        Cremona italy<br>
        1592 he was appointed as a violin player to duke vincenzo I of mantua<br>
        His multiple journeys with monteverdi made it seem like his importance was increasing, someone else was offered de werts post upon its vacancy (his death) in 1596<br>
        Dissatisfied with his situation, upon the dukes death he decided to leave the court accepting maestro di cappella of st. marks in venice in 1613<br>
        He went on and wrote some of the most influential compositions in early baroque including 1610s vespro della beata\e vergine (vespers of the blessed virgin)<br>
        He also published 9 books of madrigals between 1587 and 1651<br>

        Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632-1687)
    </h1>
    <p>
        Lully was one of the most popular Italian Baroque composers.<br>
He was born into nobility.<br>
He arrived in Paris in 1646.<br>
He was working in the Court of Louis XIV in 1653 as instrumental composer and dancer.<br>
Once he secured his spot as superintendent of music in 1661, he began writing comédies-ballets with playwright Moliére, combining italian pastoral opera with french ballet du cour.<br> In 1672 he got a license for Académie de musique, and multiple patents allowing him to control who used music in stages in other theater troupes.<br>
His style was French opera in five acts including ballet, chorus and over the top set.<br>
The style of these sets showed the way of life in Louis XIVs court perfectly.<br>
